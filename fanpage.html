        <h2>Bio</h2>
        <p>
            Pink Floyd were an English rock band formed in London in 1965. Gaining a following as a psychedelic rock group,
            they were distinguished for their extended compositions, sonic experimentation, philosophical lyrics and elaborate
            live shows, and became a leading band of the progressive rock genre. They are one of the most commercially 
            successful and influential bands in popular music history.
        </p>
        <p>
            Pink Floyd were founded by students Syd Barrett (guitar, lead vocals), Nick Mason (drums), Roger Waters 
            (bass guitar, vocals), and Richard Wright (keyboards, vocals). Under Barrett's leadership, they released
            two charting singles and a successful debut album, The Piper at the Gates of Dawn (1967). Guitarist and 
            vocalist David Gilmour joined in December 1967; Barrett left in April 1968 due to deteriorating mental 
            health. Waters became the primary lyricist and thematic leader, devising the concepts behind the albums
            The Dark Side of the Moon (1973), Wish You Were Here (1975), Animals (1977), The Wall (1979), and The 
            Final Cut (1983). The band also composed several film scores.rformance.

            Pink Floyd were one of the first British psychedelia groups, and are credited with influencing genres such 
            as progressive rock and ambient music. Four albums topped US or UK record charts; the songs "See Emily Play"
            (1967) and "Another Brick in the Wall, Part 2" (1979) were their only top 10 singles in either territory. 
            The band were inducted into the US Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1996 and the UK Music Hall of Fame in 2005. 
            By 2013, they had sold more than 250 million records worldwide, with The Dark Side of the Moon and The Wall 
            two of the best-selling albums of all time.(source:wikipedia)
